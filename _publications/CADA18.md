## Abstract
Adversarial learning has been embedded into deep networks to learn transferable representations for domain adaptation. Existing adversarial domain adaptation methods may struggle to align different domains of multimode distributions that are native in classification problems. In this paper, we present conditional adversarial domain adaptation, a novel framework that conditions the adversarial adaptation models on discriminative information conveyed in the classifier predictions. Conditional domain adversarial networks are proposed to enable discriminative adversarial adaptation of multimode domains. The experiments testify that the proposed approaches exceed the state-of-the-art performance on three domain adaptation datasets.
