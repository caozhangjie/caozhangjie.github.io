## Abstract
Action recognition has been a widely studied topic with a
heavy focus on supervised learning involving sufficient labeled videos. However, the problem of cross-domain action
recognition, where training and testing videos are drawn from
different underlying distributions, remains largely underexplored. Previous methods directly employ techniques for
cross-domain image recognition, which tend to suffer from
the severe temporal misalignment problem. This paper proposes a Temporal Co-attention Network (TCoN), which
matches the distributions of temporally aligned action features between source and target domains using a novel crossdomain co-attention mechanism. Experimental results on
three cross-domain action recognition datasets demonstrate
that TCoN improves both previous single-domain and crossdomain methods significantly under the cross-domain setting.
