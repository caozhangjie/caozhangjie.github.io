## Abstract
Imitation learning enables robots to learn from demonstrations. Previous imitation learning algorithms usually assume access to optimal expert demonstrations. However, in many real-world applications, this assumption is limiting. Most collected demonstrations are not optimal or are produced by an agent with slightly different dynamics. We therefore address the problem of imitation learning when the demonstrations can be sub-optimal or be drawn from agents with varying dynamics. We develop a metric composed of a feasibility score and an optimality score to measure how useful a demonstration is for imitation learning. The proposed score enables learning from more informative demonstrations, and disregarding the less relevant demonstrations. Our experiments on four environments in simulation and on a real robot show improved learned policies with higher expected return.
