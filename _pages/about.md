I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science Department at Stanford University starting from Autumn 2018. My Ph.D. advisor is [Prof. Dorsa Sadigh](https://dorsa.fyi/). I received my Bachelorâ€™s Degree in [Tsinghua University](http://www.tsinghua.edu.cn) (2018) and my undergraduate research advisors were [Prof. Mingsheng Long](http://ise.thss.tsinghua.edu.cn/~mlong) and [Prof. Qixing Huang](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~huangqx).

My current research interests include robotics, human-robot interaction, machine learning and computer vision. Lately, I'm working on human-robot interaction and human-modelling. I try to incoorporate domain adaptation within it to adapt human-robot interaction to new environments. Previously, I have been proposing novel problem in deep domain adaptation and developing algorithms and architectures to address them. I have also worked on projects applying domain adaptation to various applications such as hashing and action recognition.

Knowledge transfer is a interesting and charming topic. If you are also interested in this, feel free to contact with me.
