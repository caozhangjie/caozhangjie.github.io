I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science Department at Stanford University starting from Autumn 2018. I received my Bachelorâ€™s Degree in [Tsinghua University](http://www.tsinghua.edu.cn) (2018) and my undergraduate research advisors were [Prof. Mingsheng Long](http://ise.thss.tsinghua.edu.cn/~mlong) and [Prof. Qixing Huang](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~huangqx).

My current research interests include machine learning and computer vision. Lately, I have been proposing novel problem in deep domain adaptation and developing algorithms and architectures to address them. I am also working on projects in video analysis grounded on some real-world applications.

Knowledge transfer is a interesting and charming topic. If you are also interested in this, feel free to contact with me.
